# CD-CD-argoCD-sample-app
This is a repository that hosts the Dockerfile that has to be pushed to a Docker Registry implementing a CI Pipeline and then argoCD will automatically deploy it into a kubernetes cluster. Instead of deploying it to AWS EKS we will suppose that ArgoCD server and AWS EKS cluster are in the same machine.
